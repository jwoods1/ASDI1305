Project story

The MotoTracker app
	The idea behind this app is to create a easy way to track SuperCross and MotoCross riders and results.
	The idea came from a fantasy style motosports game with my friends.

(Main Page)
	When app loads user will see the main page.
		The header will have a 16x16 logo on the left side and the title in the middle,
		and a icon for a drop-down menu on the right.
		The drop-down menu will have links to the display page as well as overall results of the races.
			The main content on this page will have a image/ CTA in the middle with a create picks button under the image.
		The footer will have a search bar that will allow you to search Picks/Riders.

(Create picks page)
	The page will have same header and nav menu as main page.
		The content on page will have a text box on top to create / save user name.
		Then it will have 2 radio buttons to select series that you are picking for.
		Then it will have drop down selections which the user will pick there riders for that race.
		At the bottom will have a submit button. 
		then the view selection page will display.

(Display Page)		
	This page will load the created picks from local storage in to the view page.
		The same nav menu and header bar is used here as well.
		This page will have a image of the series they selected and list all the selected riders for the race.
		This page will also have a edit button to go back to the create page and load inputed info from local storage, and allow the users to edit there selected picks.
		This page will also have a delete button. This will clear the selected race from local storage. 
		The footer will have a search bar with the capability of searching the local storage for riders / races.
